MNTN project
=============
Hello there!
The MNTN project was realized to practice several interesting features. For instance, I've found it very fascinating for myself to try to make scroll parallax effect. The MNTN template by [Kryston Schwarze](https://krystonschwarze.com/) turned to be suitable
for my demand.
This project is based on [Gulp4](https://gulpjs.com/) ;)

You can see the project's preview on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/114016531/MNTN-project);
#### The things I used in this project:
- GULP 4;
- PUG;
- SASS/SCSS;
- JQUERY;

#### This is main stack, but this work also includes things like:
- **Mixins** and **other pug features**;
- Popular **libs** for some cases (e.g. progressive images);
- **SVG-sprites**;
- Simple **animations**;
- Cool **favicons**;
- **Eslint**;
